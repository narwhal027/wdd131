			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of Crochet Portal is to provide free patterns and tutorials for those who want to crochet but either don't know how or don't have any ideas for projects.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience for Crochet Portal is anyone who enjoys crocheting or has an interest in learning.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I inted to include several dynamic elements for the purpose of easy searching of both patterns and tutorials. The recipe book assignment will be largely inspiring for my website as far as functionality goes. The search method will use keywords like "easy, medium, hard" or "clothing, plushie, accessory". It should in theory also be able to search by item name, like "dragon plushie" or "socks".</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
